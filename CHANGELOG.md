### 0.0.4 (2019-10-20)

* Update to use progress reporting as defined in LSP 3.15. The VSCode
  extension has also been updated and should now be making use of
  this.
* Properly declare that we should support code actions. This helps
  with some clients that rely on this information to enable code
  actions (thanks @jacg).
* Fix a race condition caused by sharing the finder cache between
  concurrent compilations.
* Avoid normalizing include dirs. This avoids issues where the same
  file ends up twice in the module graph, e.g., with different casing
  for drive letters.
* More code actions.
